# Introduction

**Multivariate Pattern Search [MPS]** is a Seeq Add-on for multivariate search and similarity assessment. This Add-on 
supports both continuous and batch processes. In continuous mode, the Add-on finds multivariate profiles in time that 
are similar to a visually captured reference. 
In batch mode, the Add-on computes a multivariate similarity score per batch that allows the user to find batches that 
are similar or dissimilar to a prespecified ‘golden’ reference set. Additionally, MPS also provides a contribution score
for each signal. This allows the user to determine which signals contributed to the observed similarity or dissimilarity
and utilize that information for accelerated diagnostics/troubleshooting.
